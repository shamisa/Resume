Self Critique Memo: Project 1: COM530 Fall 2011-Professor Karl Stolley


Shamisa Ingram: Project 1 Evaluation
------------------------------------
Overall, I accomplished Project 1 objective of developing two valid well-formed XHTML web pages.  I believe I have satisfied all of the requirements and goals set forth for this project.  I was able to take the information provided via our reading assignments, class notes, in-class exercises, and class lectures and apply it towards the creation of my web pages.  Specifically, Swicegood's Pragmatic Version Control and Stolley's How to Design and Write Web Pages Today served as great resources for understanding how to build web pages and use Git (version control system).  Another resource that was extremely helpful was SitePoint (which I referred to in order to retrieve information related to XHTML and CSS concepts and structural elements).  Additionally, validating my pages against the W3C CSS and Markup Validation services facilitated my awareness of correctly applying structural content.  I also believe that meetings with the professor (during office hours) helped me to grasp a better understanding of XHTML, CSS, and Git.

I was able to properly incorporate XHTML (describe the structure of text) and CSS (describing the typography and color of structural XHTML) to my web pages (my resume and my portfolio page).  The structural tags such as heading, paragraph, list, and attributes such as class and id were used appropriately in my web design.  Furthermore, I used valid CSS structure to apply color (blue and gold theme), bullet list style, text alignment, and establish borders around text.  Additionally, I am more familiar with establishing a Git repository, adding files to the repository, committing changes, and pushing the commits to my Github repository (account).  

My Progress in COM 530 Standards Base Web-Design
------------------------------------------------
I have a better understanding of XHTML and CSS.  At first, the concept of a version control system (Git) seemed complex, but this project has definitely aided in my comprehension of Git.  I believe with continuous practice I will gain a greater command of Git.  I look forward to working on more projects.
