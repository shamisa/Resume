	<p>As a Marketing and Research Professional, I have the opportunity to produce informative articles.  Below is an article that was published in the Utah State Troopers Quarterly Magazine.  The article discusses the advancement in DNA technology, specifically, how mitochondrial DNA testing assisted in the identification of the remains in the Tomb of the Unknown Solider.</p>
	
	
	<h1>New Type of DNA Technology Identified Remains in the Tomb of the Unknown Solider</h1>
	<p>In 1972 First Lieutenant Michael Joseph Blassie 24, was presumed dead when his A-37B Dragonfly was shot down over South Vietnam.  Blassie crashed in an area controlled by enemy forces making it impossible to examine the crash site at that time.  Five months after the crash, the South Vietnamese Army patrol performed a sweep of the area, and discovered several items including: a pelvis, an upper arm bone, some ribs, remnants of a flight suit, a life raft, pieces of a parachute, and part of a USAF holster.  The evidence was turned over to the U.S. Army Central Identification Laboratory, in Hawaii, for analysis and identification.  The remains were initially classified as Lt. Blassie, but analysis of the bones was not a compelling match to Lt. Blassie age or height.  Because there was no DNA technology at the time, a positive identification could not be made of the remains.  The remains were designated as <q>Unknown</q> and assigned the number <q>X-26.</q>  The remains were laid to rest at the Tomb of the Unknown at the Arlington National Cemetery. </p>
	
	<p> In 1991 the Department of Defense founded the Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory (AFDIL). DNA Technology had surfaced and the forensic scientists at AFDIL were using advanced DNA technology to identify soldiers (unknown remains) from various wars.  The aged and damaged samples of bones (“X-26”) were analyzed through Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) testing.  Mitochondrial DNA testing is the most sensitive DNA Testing method available and is excellent for severely degraded samples. This advanced DNA technology analyzes (DNA from the maternal lineage) the maternal inheritance of a person and remains can be compared to any maternal relative (family members that share the same mother will have the same mtDNA sequences).  The remains of the unknown solider were matched to reference samples of Lt. Blassie’s mother and sister through mtDNA technology.  The mtDNA technology revealed that the remains found in South Vietnam were that of Lt. Blassie.  In 1998, Lt. Blassie was finally laid to rest near his hometown with full military honors! </p>
	
	<p> This case and other related cases revolutionized the use of mtDNA to also solve criminal cases.  Mitochondrial testing is performed at the FBI and at only a few private and state crime laboratories across the country.  MtDNA is a complex type of DNA testing that works well on highly degraded samples.  Samples such as skeletal remains, teeth and hair shafts frequently yield mitochondrial DNA results when nuclear DNA analysis is not possible.  DNA Technology has enhanced our capabilities for solving crimes.  Over the past two decades, DNA technology has been used to help identify persons in mass disasters, missing person cases, and criminal cases.  The benefits of DNA technology is exemplified in the case of the tomb of the unknown solider. DNA technology continues to play a vital role in the identification of a soldier killed in the line of duty </p>
	
	<p> Sorenson Forensics is the only private forensic DNA Laboratory in the mountain west region   (Salt Lake City, UT), that offers mtDNA technology to help law enforcement agencies solve crimes.  Specifically, Sorenson has used this DNA technology to help identify persons in mass disasters, missing person cases, and cold cases.  Sorenson has been on the cutting edge of DNA testing for eight years.  Because of Sorenson’s expertise and reputation they were selected to assist the Thai government in identifying victims of the Tsunami tragedy of December 2004. Sorenson’s laboratory efficiently tested almost 1,300 specimens to quickly reunite families with victims and help provide closure. In addition to tsunami services, Sorenson assisted the government of Chechnya in identifying the victims of the elementary school bombing in September of 2004.  Sorenson’s forensic casework experience includes analyzing cases from law enforcement agencies across the United States. </p>
